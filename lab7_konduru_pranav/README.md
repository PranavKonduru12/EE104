EE104, Lab 7: Audio Signal Processing - Noise Cancelling
Author: Pranav Konduru
Setup:
=====
- Obtained sounds from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kinguistics/heartbeat-sounds
- wav to csv converter: https://github.com/Lukious/wav-to-csv
- Python version 3.5+
- Jupyter Notebook for .ipnyb files
- Spyder IDE or Visual Studios Code to open and run .py files
- May need to install few libraries such as scipy, matplotlib, and/or pgzero
- Will need to do “pip install scipy” and/or “pip install matplotlip” on terminal for linux/Mac or command line for Windows 
- Can use Desmos.com to develop functions

Projects/Activities:
==============

FFT/IFFT Audio Signal Processing — Noise Cancellation Application:
******************************************************************************
- Can run the file using any python environment with compiler such as Spyder IDE or Visual Studios Code
- .py version is also available to run on either Spyder IDE or Visual Studios Code

Heart Rate Analysis — Time Domain Measurement — Biotechnology 
******************************************************************************
- Can be run using Jupyter notebook from Anaconda
  - .py version is also available to run on either Spyder IDE or Visual Studios Code
- Converting the wav to csv
  - Download (cloned) project from github
  - Add heartrate wav file into the directory/folder on the wav-to-csv project called "wavfile"
  - Run wav2csv.py file on any python environment with compiler such as Spyder IDE or Visual Studios Code
  - A prompt in the compiler will show up asking to input the name of the wav file that was placed in wavfile directory
  - Put the name of wav file and hit enter
  - csv version of the file should be made within the project directory
- Part 1: identifies and calculates the peaklist and BPM (beats per minute) of the heartrate signal 
- Part 2: identifies the high and low frequencies of the heartrate signal

Game Development — Read Alert
******************************************************************************
- Can run the file using any python environment with compiler such as Spyder IDE or Visual Studio Code
  - Click on the red snowflake before it touches the bottom of the screen
  - Clicking on non-red snowflake will lead to game ending
    - Can continue game with space
  - Game ends after 3 or 4 rounds
